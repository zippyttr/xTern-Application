File Made in Jupyter Notebook.
Final analysis:
- Fan Challenges Completed: Users have completed between 1 and 10 challenges, with an average of 5.79.
- Predictive Accuracy: Ranges from 50% to 98%, with an average of about 75%.
- Virtual Merchandise Purchases: Users have purchased up to 6 items, averaging 2.67.
- Sponsorship Interactions: Users clicked on ads between 0 and 19 times, averaging 8.68 clicks.
- Time on Live 360: Users spent between 60 and 199 minutes, with an average of 129 minutes.
- Real-Time Chat Activity: The number of messages ranges from 0 to 49, with an average of 25.

- Encouraging users to complete fan challenges can result in more virtual merchandise being bought. The user's predictive accuracy does not matter in this case.
- It appears that fan challenges can possibly distract users from clicking on ads.
- The longer the user is on live, the better their predictive accuracy gets, but their chances for buying merch or clicking on ads slightly decrease.
- A user is slightly more likely to buy merch if they click on more ads.

A sample size of 100 is not sufficient to calculate trends on such an app. This is evident when the linear regression model does not work. There is extremely weak correlation between most variables.
